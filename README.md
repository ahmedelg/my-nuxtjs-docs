### **Introduction**

_"If you're looking to build **`Azure Static Web Apps`**, then Nuxt.js can help you. Nuxt.js is an `intuitive web framework` based on official **`Vue.js libraries`**, `Node.js`, and **`powerful development tools`**, such as `Webpack`, `Bubble`, and `PostCSS`. **The goal** of Nuxt.js is to make `web development` `intuitive` and `performant` with a great developer experience in mind"._ (microsoft1) (microsoft2)

_"Nuxt.js is a free and open source `JavaScript library` based on `Vue.js`, `Node.js`, `Webpack` and `Babel.js`. Nuxt is inspired by `Next.js`,which is a framework of `similar purpose`, based on `React.js`."_ (Wiki)

_"The framework is advertised as a `Meta-framework for universal applications`. The term universal is used here with the meaning that the goal of the framework is to `enable users to create web views in JavaScript` `utilizing the Vue.js single file component system` and that can function both as in-browser single page application (SPA) views as well as server-rendered web views which are then (after server rendering) "rehydrated" to full SPA functionality.Additionally, the framework enables users to have the `content`, or `parts of it`, fully `pre-rendered on the server` and served in the manner of `static site generators`."_ (Wiki)

_"Nuxt.js provides all the `configuration` needed to make your `Vue.js application development` interesting & It is used to make `Desktop applications`, `Mobile applications`, `Static generated applications`, `Progressive web applications`, and `Universal applications`."_ (Mobiosolutions)
